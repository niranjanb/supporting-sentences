68-1	A car skids along the road and smoke appears to be coming from under the tires.
68-2	"Typical car tires rotate over the surface of the road without slipping, thus the coefficient of static friction determines a car's maximum acceleration in most situations."
68-3	The net external force stopping a car comes from the friction force between tires and pavement.
68-4	"Tread wear, also known as tire wear, is caused by friction between the tire and the road surface."
68-5	"When this happens, the tires skid and the coefficient of kinetic friction determines the braking distance."
68-6	Driving car Your car would not start moving if it wasn't for the friction of the tires against the street.
68-7	"If a car is moving on a plane, then since the bottom of the wheel is pushing backward against the road; the force of friction is in the forward direction."
68-8	This area transmits forces between the tire and the road via friction.
68-9	"On higher traction surfaces like bitumen the tyre will begin to shred and melt from the friction, producing white smoke."

68-24	"Most street riding will not put a sufficient amount of friction on the tire to maintain the optimal tire temperature, especially in colder climates and in spring and fall."
68-25	Hook up (drag racing) Good traction between tires and track resulting in increased acceleration and reduced slipping or smoking of tires.
68-26	Between 70 to 80 studs are driven into a tire to provide better friction between the ice and the soft rubber in winter tires.
68-27	"When hydroplaning occurs, the tire effectively ""floats"" above the road surface on a cushion of water – and loses traction, braking and steering, creating a very unsafe driving condition."
68-28	"Namely, the load sensitivity of most real tires in their typical operating range is such that the coefficient of friction decreases as the vertical load, Fz, increases."
68-29	"Wastes energy In any type of vehicle—such as a car, boat or airplane—excess friction means that extra fuel must be used to power the vehicle."
68-30	"However, too much friction can be a nuisance, because it can hinder motion and cause the need for expending extra energy."
68-31	Wheel hop (drag racing) violent shaking of the car as the tires lose and regain traction in quick succession.
68-32	They also clean the tire of any debris and lay down a layer of rubber by the starting line for better traction.

25-5	Liquid to Gas Phase Change When liquid state of a matter changes to gaseous state by absorption of heat it is known as vaporization.
25-6	When whole gas is transformed into liquid and heat is removed from it temperature of liquid reduces to a certain temperature known as freezing point.
25-7	After that as more heat is applied there is no rise in temperature of liquid and it starts transforming to gas state.
25-8	When boiling point is reached and heat absorption is continued then liquid start transforming into gas till all liquid is converted into gas.
25-9	Any additional cooling or heat loss will not lower the temperature until all of the gas is condensed into the liquid state.
25-10	"Since heat or thermal energy is releases during the process of conversion of gas to liquid, it is exothermic process in nature."
25-11	"The latent heat, also called the heat of vaporization, is the amount of energy necessary to change a liquid to a vapour at constant temperature and pressure."
25-12	"While physicists have a good theoretical understanding of the heat capacity of both solids and gases, a general theory of the heat capacity of liquids has always remained elusive."
25-13	"This is used almost exclusively for liquids and solids, since for gases it may be confused with specific heat capacity at constant volume."
25-14	"When the material changes from solid to liquid, large amount of heat is absorbed."
25-15	"When the material is changed from liquid to solid, large amount of heat is released."
25-16	When a gas changes to a solid directly by removing heat then it is known as deposition.
25-17	While gradually a gas changes to solid in two steps: When the heat is removed from the gas then its temperature reduces to a certain level.
25-18	"eg for water: Heat fusion (solid->liquid) = 6.01 kJ/mol, Heat of vaporization (liquid->gas) = 40.68 kJ/mol The temperature change is a little more complex."

25-33	Burning 2.75 cubic meters of natural gas releases about one therm of energy in the form of heat.
25-34	When freezing point is reached and heat removal is continued then liquid start transforming into solid till all liquid is converted into solid.
25-35	It happens in the following way: As we remove heat from liquid its temperature reduces till a point which is freezing point and after that it starts converting into solid.
25-36	"When whole solid is transformed into liquid and more heat is absorbed by it, temperature of liquid rises to a certain point known as boiling point."
25-37	This happens in the following way : When the heat is removed or released from the gas then its temperature reduces to a certain level.
25-38	"We see that removing heat from the gas reduces its temperature to point E to D, D to C, C to B and finally from B to A."
25-39	Heating a solid provides the particles with the heat of fusion necessary to allow them to escape one another’s influence enough to move about in the liquid state.
25-40	"Because each phonon mode contributes to the specific heat, it is very important to know how many modes occur in a liquid of interest."

25-42	"For example, the heat capacity of water ice at the melting point is about 4.6 R per mole of molecules, but only 1.5 R per mole of atoms."
25-43	"So, liquid water would release more energy than ice, just like steam releases more energy than liquid water, because liquid water actually has more energy in it."

25-50	"These states or phase can be of various types: Liquid Gas Solid Every state has its own characteristic properties, Plasma is another state possible in rare cases."
84-1	"In fact, it takes almost seven times as much energy to turn liquid water into pure steam than it does to turn ice into purely liquid water."
84-2	This phase is often called the liquid crystal cholesteric phase because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives.
84-3	"Due to the fact that the particles in a liquid are farther apart than those of a solid, liquids tend to be less dense than solids."

84-26	"On the other hand, their arrangement is loose enough that the particles tend to move around one another rather than simply vibrate in place the way solid particles do."
84-27	"That is that heating will eventually drive them into a conventional liquid phase characterized by random and isotropic molecular ordering (little to no long-range order), and fluid-like flow behavior."
84-28	"If the temperature rise is too high, thermal motion will destroy the delicate cooperative ordering of the LC phase, pushing the material into a conventional isotropic liquid phase."

72-19	Precipitation develops in two stages.
72-20	"Graupel is distinct from hail, small hail and ice pellets: the World Meteorological Organization defines small hail as snow pellets encapsulated by ice, a precipitation halfway between graupel and hail."
72-21	Precipitation elements (ice crystals or droplets that form around soluble particles such as salt) form directly from the vapour state and get larger through collision and coalescence.
72-22	"North and south of this are regions of descending air that form where precipitation is low; the land surface underneath is usually arid, which forms most of the Earth's deserts."
72-23	Satellites such as the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission employ microwave sensors to form precipitation estimates.
72-24	"Precipitation that falls to earth in the form of frozen or partially frozen raindrops, often when the temperature is near the freezing point."
72-25	"Much precipitation begins in the form of ice crystals, develops into snow flakes, but melts as it falls, to become rain."
