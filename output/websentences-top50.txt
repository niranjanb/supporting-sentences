0.7622	68-1	A car skids along the road and smoke appears to be coming from under the tires.
0.6931	68-2	Typical car tires rotate over the surface of the road without slipping, thus the coefficient of static friction determines a car's maximum acceleration in most situations.
0.6931	68-3	The net external force stopping a car comes from the friction force between tires and pavement.
0.6931	68-4	Tread wear, also known as tire wear, is caused by friction between the tire and the road surface.
0.6265	68-5	When this happens, the tires skid and the coefficient of kinetic friction determines the braking distance.
0.6265	68-6	Driving car Your car would not start moving if it wasn't for the friction of the tires against the street.
0.6265	68-7	If a car is moving on a plane, then since the bottom of the wheel is pushing backward against the road; the force of friction is in the forward direction.
0.6218	68-8	Since the tires are slipping, the coefficient of kinetic friction determines the maximum acceleration.
0.6218	68-9	The car is then stopped using the force of static friction alone.
0.6218	68-10	Use the data in vorite data analysis software to determine the coefficient of static friction of car tires on pavement.
0.6218	68-11	Static friction is therefore the net force acting on a braking car.

0.6218	68-14	Problems from friction Friction can cause problems or be a nuisance that you try to minimize.
0.6218	68-15	Thus, the energy that is "lost" to friction in trying to move an object is really turned to heat energy.
0.6218	68-16	This increases rolling resistance, tire flexing, and friction between the road and tire.

0.5808	68-24	Wheel hop (drag racing) violent shaking of the car as the tires lose and regain traction in quick succession.
0.5808	68-25	However, too much friction can be a nuisance, because it can hinder motion and cause the need for expending extra energy.
0.5808	68-26	Wastes energy In any type of vehicle—such as a car, boat or airplane—excess friction means that extra fuel must be used to power the vehicle.

0.5808	68-28	Between 70 to 80 studs are driven into a tire to provide better friction between the ice and the soft rubber in winter tires.
0.5808	68-29	Most street riding will not put a sufficient amount of friction on the tire to maintain the optimal tire temperature, especially in colder climates and in spring and fall.
0.5808	68-30	When hydroplaning occurs, the tire effectively "floats" above the road surface on a cushion of water – and loses traction, braking and steering, creating a very unsafe driving condition.
0.5808	68-31	The heat transfer from the tire to a cold road will be very small as compared to the amount of heat generated due to the flexing of the tire.
0.5789	68-32	They also clean the tire of any debris and lay down a layer of rubber by the starting line for better traction.
0.5789	68-33	The convenient thing to do for this problem is to let friction be the negative one.

0.6069	290-12	Here’s what you need to know to protect tender plants from freezing temperatures.
0.6069	290-13	Protect Tender Sprouts: Cover tender plants overnight with an inverted bucket or flower pot, or with a layer of .
0.6069	290-14	It can leave a gardener wondering how to protect plants from freezing and what is the best way to cover and keep plants from freezing.
0.5854	290-15	It's best to avoid using plastic or sheets alone to protect plants from frost, since these materials can trap inside, which can freeze and damage the plant.
0.5854	290-16	For strawberries, you should put mulch over the plants to protect early growing buds that will someday be fruit.
0.5854	290-17	The temperature zone might have nothing to do with whether a plant survives a frost, though.
0.5854	290-18	As the air temperature approaches freezing, the surface temperature of plants can dip below freezing, causing ice crystals to form in the same manner that dew forms on warmer nights.
0.5854	290-19	Black frost is a term used when frost didn’t form, but plants were nonetheless damaged (and blackened) by freezing temperatures.
0.5854	290-20	Effects of Freezing Temperatures on Plants For all but the most tender plants, it doesn’t matter whether the conditions produced a frost or a freeze.
0.5854	290-21	"Hardy" plants tolerate some amount of short-term freezing, while "tender" plants are killed or injured by freezing temperatures.
0.5854	290-22	It can leave a gardener wondering how to protect plants from freezing and what is the best way to cover plants.
0.5854	290-23	For added protection when you protect plants in a freeze, you can place plastic over the sheets or blankets to help keep warmth in.
0.5854	290-24	If you have time before a freeze happens, you can also create insulation barriers around a plant as a way how to protect plants from freezing.
0.5854	290-25	When your bedding plants are exposed to frost, they may not survive unless you have taken the time to warm their surroundings or cover them during cold temperatures.
0.5854	290-26	By taking preventative measures, you can protect your bedding plants from being exposed to and suffering from frost in cold temperatures.
0.5854	290-27	This procedure will help you determine if you need to protect your bedding plants from frost at any given time, especially during seasonal and temperature changes.
0.5854	290-28	You may want to water your bedding plants up to 1 or 2 days before freezing conditions are expected.
0.5854	290-29	Thus it is advisable not to cultivate the soil just before a killing frost is expected if plant parts near the ground need to be protected.
0.5854	290-30	A forecast of the duration that temperatures are expected to remain below freezing is very useful when using this method.
0.5854	290-31	It is important to recognize that this method only prevents the temperature of the protected plant from falling below the freezing point.
0.5808	290-32	Black frost often is called "killing frost" because white frost tends to be less cold, partly because the latent heat of freezing of the water reduces the temperature drop.
0.5808	290-33	Most plants respond well to covering, but particularly delicate ones may not survive the winter outside, even with the added insulation.
0.5808	290-34	Covering them up too early could increase the number of times they have to go through dangerous cycles of freezing and thawing.

0.5808	290-40	Steps to take when frost or freeze threaten tender plants: Bring Indoors: Frost-tender plants in containers should be brought inside during cold weather.
0.5808	290-41	Cover Shrubs and Trees: Larger plants can be covered with fabric, old bed sheets, burlap, or commercial frost cloths (avoid using plastic).
0.5808	290-42	Site selection is important Elevation, surface reflectivity, soil properties, canopy cover and proximity of structures or plants can all affect heat radiation within your landscape.
0.5808	290-43	Active methods are those which are used when the danger of a freeze is present and include such techniques as adding heat and covering crops.
0.5808	290-44	Mulches underneath plants prevent heat coming out of the soil at night from reaching these plants and thereby result in lower plant temperatures.
0.5789	290-45	In most temperate countries such temperatures usually are the result of heat loss by radiation at night, so those types of frost sometimes are called radiation frost.
0.5789	290-46	Vegetation is not necessarily damaged when leaf temperatures drop below the freezing point of their cell contents.
0.5789	290-47	Other Strategies There are also things you can do before the threat of frost to help your plants survive, such as fertilizing them in the late spring.

0.5789	392-39	The Moon is in synchronous rotation, meaning that it keeps the same face turned toward the Earth at all times.
0.5789	392-40	As a result, the angular velocity of the Moon varies as it moves around the Earth and hence is not always equal to the Moon's rotational velocity.
0.5789	392-41	Since the orbital velocity of the Moon about the Earth (1 km/s) is small compared to the orbital velocity of the Earth about the Sun (30 km/s), this never occurs.

0.424	197-40	How It Works The effects of air resistance on the behavior of projectiles can be quite complex.
0.424	197-41	In a vacuum, where air resistance plays no part, the effects of g are clearly demonstrated.
0.424	197-42	Mass Naturally, air resistance changes the terms of the above equation.
0.424	197-43	The speed of descent is a function of air resistance rather than mass, which can be proved with the following experiment.
0.424	197-44	Now to analyze the motion of a projectile in a situation without air resistance.
0.424	197-45	Assuming, once again, that air resistance is not a factor, the vertical acceleration of a projectile is g.
0.424	197-46	This puts a spin on the projectile, and air resistance does the rest.
0.424	197-47	Thus, the ball is moving from left to right, and therefore the direction of airflow is from right to left.

0.5392	284-29	The eggs are highly vulnerable to predation, so frogs have evolved many techniques to ensure the survival of the next generation.
0.5392	284-30	The eggs of some species laid out of water can detect vibrations of nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten.
0.5392	284-31	Other species go through their whole larval phase inside the eggs or the mother, or they have direct development.

0.6265	96-1	For example, to observe an apple you have to shine light on it so that you can observe the reflected light.
0.6265	96-2	The real rule is that no information can be transmitted from one place to another faster than the speed of light.
0.6265	96-3	This is another way of understanding why the extended source has a penumbra that is neither light nor dark -- these regions can only see part of the light bulb.
0.6048	96-4	I do not understand how we can look back toward the big bang and see light that is some billions of years old.
0.5854	96-5	It is thought to be about 15 billion years old, so we can only see objects as far away as the distance light can travel in 15 billion years.
0.5854	96-6	ANSWER:  The laser will not work because laser light is of one color and that is the only color you could see reflected back.
0.5854	96-7	If the "observer" were one of the two objects, he would see the other approaching him with a speed less than the speed of light but would suffer the collision.
0.5854	96-8	null QUESTION:  This is about distance, height of eye, and how far one can see from one location on earth to another location on earth.
0.5854	96-9	Can be made with two parallel mirrors[when light is passed through the mirror it reflects and bounces making a v_shape pattern]., which proves speed of light differs in different frames.
0.5854	96-10	It is because they can "see inside" one another and rearrange their charges resulting to a very strong interaction.
0.5808	96-11	This is 1/30 of the light reflected by the current standard for blackness, and one third the light reflected by the previous record holder for darkest substance.
0.5808	96-12	However, for a nuclear reaction to take place you need to get the nucleus of one atom close to another and that takes extremely hight energies.
0.5808	96-13	For example, electron diffraction can be observed by sending in electrons one at a time, although you will have to wait a long time to see the pattern build up.
0.5808	96-14	On earth, very light objects like dust can be held aloft for years by the air; on the moon, dust will settle on the surface unimpeded.
0.5808	96-15	But light packets don't have a discernible "thickness" where one part hits before another (I don't think!) so that analogy breaks down for me! Sorry for rambling, I'm just confused.
0.5808	96-16	However, one can work hard to minimize these forces in the design of cars; making the cars aerodyamic, reducing the weight, and other tricks can minimize the energy we lose.
0.5808	96-17	I can see that gravity would attract the nearest parts of the object more strongly, but I don't see why that would stretch the object.
0.5808	96-18	Suppose that a particular object we wish to see has an intensity of only one photon per second per square meter at our distance.
0.5808	96-19	The wave function, often a complex function, has no physical meaning on its own, but everything knowable can be extracted from it in one way or another.
0.5808	96-20	You will see that the slope of the binding energy curve is much greater for light nuclei fusing than heavy nuclei fissioning.
0.5808	96-21	(You can see why g is called the acceleration due to gravity.) QUESTION:  I know that Kinetic energy and Momentum are related to each other.
0.5808	96-22	ANSWER:  If an object were truly black (absorbed all light striking it), you would not be able to see any detail on it.
0.5808	96-23	Most objects (like the ground) absorb visible light and radiate infrared, so if there is an absorber of infrared blanketing the earth, that energy is trapped.
0.5808	96-24	An object a room temperature radiates most of the energy in the infrared part of the spectrum so you cannot see it in a dark room.
0.5808	96-25	Suppose you had a flashlight with one single wavelength and the light was coherent (you would call that a laser).
0.5808	96-26	So if one thing is hot and another cold, the hot one has a higher average energy per atom.
0.5808	96-27	And light can certainly convert into mass; the best known example is called where a photon (with sufficiently high energy) turns into an electron-positron pair.
0.5808	96-28	Furthermore, neither clock will register one year since that is the time that it takes light to go and no spaceship can ever go that fast.
0.5808	96-29	The brain now interprets this lack of light as meaning that a dark object was placed above the center line and that is what you see.
0.5808	96-30	Imagine a stick with a flashbulb and a light detector at one end and a mirror at the other end.
0.5808	96-31	So, you can see why a hollow object will float—because it is bigger than a solid object of the same material so it displaces more water.
0.5808	96-32	When light enters a medium, it will be absorbed only if there are electronic levels in the atoms and molecules which can receive the energy of the light.
0.5808	96-33	One has a direct path to me, but the other one passes near a very massive object, which causes the light to "bend".
0.5808	96-34	Nothing can go faster than the speed of light; no material object may go as fast as the speed of light.
0.5808	96-35	I have also read about the speed of light and how long it takes light to travel from one point to another.
0.5808	96-36	Perhaps you can see why many people (myself included) believe that the only sensible long-term solution to our energy problems is to utilize solar power.
0.5808	96-37	Of course, if you give the lighter string more amplitude it will start with the same energy as the heavier one but it will also probably radiate more sound energy.
0.5808	96-38	Imagine that there is some substance which is colorless but that you can paint on a wall and light reflected from it will be polarized.
0.5808	96-39	The energy E required can be found from knowing the potential energy U of an object of mass m in the gravitational field of a mass M.
0.5808	96-40	ANSWER: The pinhole forms an image on the paper, so if light can pass through the paper at all, you can see the image.
0.5808	96-41	Light which is reflected exerts twice as much force as light which is absorbed because it does not lose any energy.
0.5808	96-42	If the object is free to vibrate and the wind causes vibrations of one or more of the resonant frequencies of the object, the result can be quite dramatic.
0.5808	96-43	When an object is in free fall (meaning it is not in contact with anything, so after it has left the ramp), it can only do one thing—fall.
0.5808	96-44	It states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant, so any energy in one form always ends up in another form.
0.5808	96-45	The turning on of the flashlight being one that has happened to many over the years and in same situation flash light batteries are dead flat.
0.5632	96-46	the man is holding onto a knob(which he can grab to stick to the wall) like thing in one side...
0.5632	96-47	The correct definition of momentum is not mv but p=√[(E/c)2-m2c2] where E is the energy and c is the speed of light.
0.5632	96-48	I understand that it costs energy to raise an object to some height “h” which gives the object gravitational potential energy.
0.5632	96-49	Conversely, if a system binds, the resulting object has less mass than what you started with and therefore energy is released.
0.5392	96-50	Absorption of light is contrasted by e transmission, (physics) reflection and eflection diffusion, where the light is only redirected, causing objects to appear transparent, reflective or white respectively.

0.6458	233-3	ANSWER: Whenever you split a light nucleus you must put energy in.
0.6458	233-4	And it is nowhere near the speed of light except for a black hole.
0.6458	233-5	I.e the moving spaceship and light beam theroretical experiment etc.
0.6458	233-6	Light striking the window from either side will be partly reflected and partly transmitted.

0.6218	233-12	Technically, ason is that any particle with any mass would have to be given an inifinite amount of energy to accelerate it to the speed of light.
0.6218	233-13	Light has its origin in transitions in atoms where an electron moves from one orbit to another.
0.6218	233-14	Matter becomes more dense and you would need an infinate amount of energy as you approach the speed of light.

0.5808	233-29	QUESTION: Why couldn't a scientist accelerate a metal object to near light speed by building a electromagnet around a long vacuum tube with a metal object (ball) within it.
0.5808	233-30	The only thing observers in all frames agree on is the speed of light—all observers measure the speed of a beam of light to be the same.
0.5808	233-31	A rocket departs from the space station at exactly the same time, accelerating at a certain rate, directly towards the ray of light.
0.5808	233-32	But light packets don't have a discernible "thickness" where one part hits before another (I don't think!) so that analogy breaks down for me! Sorry for rambling, I'm just confused.
0.5808	233-33	Second, this energy is completely converted into forms we understand, namely the kinetic energy of the products and radiation (light and other electromagnetic waves).
0.5808	233-34	I understand that it is accepted the light travels at a constant and that nothing ( other then theoretical particals already doing so ) can travel faster then it..
0.5808	233-35	Regarding the light clock, the point is that the speed of light is the same in either moving or stationary frame.
0.5808	233-36	But, the guy you are speeding past will see all clocks running at the same rate but slow because the light clock is demonstrably slow.
0.5808	233-37	Once you can accept the fact that the speed of light is the same for all observers, the rest of relativity just falls into place; read my .
0.5808	233-38	I tried substituting for m from the equation E = mc^2 but this gave me an answer much higher than light speed.
0.5808	233-39	All light waves are composed of a continuous distribution of different wavelengths; the distribution might be very narrowly peaked around a particular length, but never exactly one wavelength.
0.5808	233-40	ANSWER:  The laser will not work because laser light is of one color and that is the only color you could see reflected back.
0.5808	233-41	Even if the orbit were 2 light years, the geostationary object would complete 2 light years in 24 hours time, the exact same as a 50 thousand mile geostationary orbit..

0.5808	233-43	We often refer to the speed of light as the speed of any electromagnetic wave since all travel with the same speed in vacuum.
0.5808	233-44	Whether the stimulus is a physical one like a light or sound, or a piece of information requiring an assessment about its truth, information is almost always deviates from goodness.
0.5789	233-45	My question is if the galaxy is 5 billion light years away the light we now receive is also 5 billion years old.
0.5789	233-46	Or does the earth receive light from every area of the sun that faces the earth.
0.5789	233-47	Now assume that I travel at 99.99% speed of light (almost 3.8 * 108 m/s) for 100 years (100 years for the earth) and then I stop.

0.5854	395-3	From a conceptual standpoint, Newton's third law is seen when a person walks: they push against the floor, and the floor pushes against the person.
0.5808	395-4	For that reason, the term "efficiency" will be used as a loose synonym for mechanical advantage—even though the technical definition is rather different.
0.5808	395-5	Several centuries before Archimedes's time, the Greeks were using compound pulleys that contained several wheels and thus provided the operator with much greater mechanical advantage than a fixed pulley.
0.5808	395-6	Due to the ways in which wedges are used, however, friction plays a much greater role, therefore greatly reducing the theoretical mechanical advantage.
0.5789	395-7	The mechanical advantage of a wedge is given by the ratio of the length of its slope to its width.
0.5789	395-8	This amplification, or mechanical advantage is the ratio of the input speed to output speed.

0.5789	395-12	The newtonian laws have proved valid for all mechanical problems not involving speeds comparable with the speed of light and not involving atomic or .
0.5789	395-13	Virtually all mechanical devices are variations on three basic machines: the , the , and the hydraulic press.
0.5789	395-14	Likewise, the majority of machines invented and built during most of the classical period worked according to the mechanical principles of plain gravitational force.
0.5789	395-15	Then came the development of electronic power, thanks to Thomas Edison (1847-1931) and others, and machines became increasingly divorced from basic mechanical laws.
0.5789	395-16	Mechanical Advantage A common trait runs through all forms of machinery: mechanical advantage, or the ratio of force output to force input.
0.5789	395-17	In the case of the lever, a simple machine that will be discussed in detail below, mechanical advantage is high.
0.5789	395-18	In some machines, however, mechanical advantage is actually less than 1, meaning that the resulting force is less than the applied force.
0.5789	395-19	In these and many more cases, mechanical advantage alone does not measure the benefit.
0.5789	395-20	Most machines, however, work best when mechanical advantage is maximized.
0.5789	395-21	Yet mechanical advantage—whether in theoretical terms or real-life instances—can only go so high, because there are factors that limit it.
0.5789	395-22	For centuries, inventors have dreamed of creating a mechanism with an almost infinite mechanical advantage.
0.5789	395-23	As output compounded over the years, its ratio to input would become so high that the figure for mechanical advantage would approach infinity.
0.5789	395-24	In light of this tendency to discuss physical processes in idealized terms, it should be noted that there are two types of mechanical advantage: theoretical and actual.
0.5789	395-25	Efficiency, as applied to machines in its most specific scientific sense, is the ratio of actual to theoretical mechanical advantage.
0.5789	395-26	As with other mechanical processes, the actual mechanical advantage of a machine is a much more complicated topic than the theoretical mechanical advantage.
0.5789	395-27	Therefore, the only form of mechanical advantage that a physicist can easily discuss is theoretical.
0.5789	395-28	The relationship between input and output force and lever arm then makes it possible to determine a formula for the lever's mechanical advantage.
0.5789	395-29	Since FinLin = FoutLout (where F = force and L = lever arm), it is possible to set up an equation for a lever's mechanical advantage.
0.5789	395-30	Once again, mechanical advantage is always Fout/Fin, but with a lever, it is also Lin/Lout.
0.5789	395-31	Hence, the mechanical advantage of a lever is always the same as the inverse ratio of the lever arm.
0.5789	395-32	The Class III lever has a mechanical advantage of less than 1, but what it loses in force output in gains in range of motion.
0.5789	395-33	Given what was already said about the equation for mechanical advantage in a lever, this presents a very fortunate circumstance.
0.5789	395-34	Therefore, the larger the wheel in proportion to the axle, the greater the mechanical advantage.
0.5789	395-35	Thus, the theoretical mechanical advantage of a fixed pulley is 1 (or almost certainly less under actual conditions, where friction is a factor).
0.5789	395-36	The simplest kind of compound pulley, with just two wheels, has a mechanical advantage of 2.
0.5789	395-37	Thus mechanical advantage is never as great as it might be.
0.5789	395-38	If the ramp length were doubled to 16 ft (4.88 m), the mechanical advantage would likewise double to 4, and so on.
0.5789	395-39	Again, the mechanical advantage of a wedge is the ratio of length to height, which, in the knife, would be the depth of the blade compared to its cross-sectional width.
0.5789	395-40	In order to determine its mechanical advantage, one must first find the pitch, which is the distance between adjacent threads.
0.5789	395-41	Either number is equal to the mechanical advantage for a screw.
0.5789	395-42	But this is exactly what the screw is designed to do, and what it lacks in mechanical advantage, it more than makes up in its holding power.
0.5789	395-43	The mechanical advantage of a hydraulic pump is equal to the vertical distance to which the input force is applied, divided by that of the output force.
0.5789	395-44	Hence, the greater the height of the input cylinder compared to the output cylinder, the greater the mechanical advantage.

0.6069	384-34	A physical change: Possibly can change with state of matter (sublimation, decomposition, evaporation, melting, freezing, and condensation).
0.5854	384-35	When a substance is in a solid state, it can absorb a lot of energy in the form of heat until it hits its melting point.
0.5854	384-36	It often helps to think of an ice cube when thinking of phase changes.
0.5854	384-37	For example, water is still- chemically- H2O whether it is in a solid state (ice), liquid, or gas (water vapor).
0.5854	384-38	Vaporization is a physical change because it is the change of state form from a liquid to a gas, which I am sure you probably already know.
0.5854	384-39	the ice changes into water after melting .this is temporary change as the property says.
0.5808	384-40	Mutually immiscible liquid phases are formed from water (aqueous phase), hydrophobic organic solvents, perfluorocarbons ( chemistry fluorous phase), silicones, several different metals, and also from molten phosphorus.
0.5789	384-41	Now the liquid can absorb energy in the form of heat for quite a while until it gets to its boiling point.
0.5789	384-42	The water gets hotter and hotter, absorbing more and more heat, but it is still all in the liquid stage.
0.5789	384-43	For a long time the water is in both liquid and vapor stage, stage IV on the graph.
0.5789	384-44	If you wait long enough all the water will eventually turn into steam, and all of the liquid will be in a gaseous stage - stage V on the graph.

0.5789	384-46	A liquid has a definite volume but not a definite shape, and it thus takes the shape of the container in which it is.
0.5789	384-47	When more heat is added, the liquid substance evaporates and becomes a gas, which has no bonds at all.
0.5789	384-48	Most of the water is in the liquid phase, where it is held by the mutual attraction of water molecules.
0.5789	384-49	Likewise, every once in a while a vapor molecule collides with the liquid surface and condenses into the liquid.
0.5789	384-50	In the diagram, the blue line marking the boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely, but terminates at a point called the (thermodynamics) critical point.
